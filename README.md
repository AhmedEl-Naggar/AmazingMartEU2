📊 Project Overview

This project is my first Tableau dashboard, created to analyze and visualize sales performance across multiple dimensions such as category, sub-category, region, and quantity sold. The goal was to transform raw data into clear, actionable insights through intuitive visualizations.

The dashboard provides a full sales summary, helping users quickly understand performance trends and identify top-performing product groups and regions.
